# ECE-4424-Final-Project
	The overall goal of this project is to do something that nobody else has ever done before. We want to take an existing machine learning model and improve it so it can better solve a classification problem. Our problem is the classification of Iris flower dataset. The dataset has three different type of Iris flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. The dataset is a balanced and unbiased. It consists of 50 different samples of each Iris flowers. Each sample has four distinct features: length of sepals, width of sepals, length of petals and width of petals.
